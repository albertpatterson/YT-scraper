## Web Scraping

Web scraping can be painful and time consuming to set up, especially for sites that require authentication. Also, debugging can be difficult as well. However, using a simple browser extension greatly simplifies the process as it can be run directly in the browser without additional configuration. Not only is this faster to set up, but debugging can be performed via the familiar browser dev tools. For small, one off jobs this can greatly simplify the process.
